The study party app is designed to connect students taking the same courses with one another to form "study parties". Inspired by the concept of looking for studymates on groups like Facebook Class Pages, and the party system of many video games today, this app serves as that meeting ground for new connections. Supported by the Android platform, users can search for a UCI-specific course and find the list of other students in the same course who are likewise looking for studymates. Additional options such as preferred party size, meeting time, location, and purpose of meeting are also available. 

This project is requires a working AsterixDB BAD instance running as the backend database.
